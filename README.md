This Project has the same ability as GOOGLE . It has the same functionality like google and uses the orignal google search engine for the queries.

Basically in this project I have developed three pages 

1. Google Search page
2. Google Image search page
3. Google advanced search page.

In addition to all these pages I have also included links at the bottom and other links as shown in google.
