# googlesearch-clone

This project is a google search clone. It is developed using Html, Css and a little javaScript .

Check It Out At : 

This Project has the same ability as Google search . It has the same functionality like google and uses the orignal google search engine for the queries.

## Basically in this project I have developed three pages :

1. Google Search page
2. Google Image search page
3. Google advanced search page.

In addition to all these pages I have also included links at the bottom and other links as shown in google.

# Google Search Page 

## Interface

1. In google search page, I have included the links of google image search and google advanced search in the top right corner along with the Sign in button.
2. Then I have used the image of the google from original google search page.
3. I have added two buttons that acts similar to google's buttons . One is google search and other one is feeling lucky button.
4. At the footer of the page, I included some links as shown in the google.

## Workflow

1. User can navigate to other pages from the top right corner links and even sign in to their google's account .
2. Then there is search field where user can search queries and that links to the google search. User can either just press the enter key or use the Google Search button to find the result. Alternatively, you can use I'm feeling lucky button to redirect directly to the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

# Google Image Search Page

## Interface

1. In google image search page, I have included the links of google;s page and Sign In button in the top right corner.
2. Then I have used the image of the google image search.
3. I have added the search icon.
4. At last of the page, I have some links as shown in the google.

## Workflow

1. User can navigate to other pages from the top right corner links and also through the google image .
2. Then there is search field where user can search their queries and that links to the google search and shows user the result of images matched of given query. User can either just press the enter key or use the Search icon just at the right corner of your query field to find the result.

# Google Advanced Search Page

## Interface
1. In google advance search page, i have included google image.
2. Then there is a heading displaying advanced search.
3. Then there are input fields:
      <ul>
        <li>Input field for the important words.</li>
        <li>Input field for the exact words in quotes.</li>
        <li>Input field for miniature OR standard words.</li>
        <li>Input field for the words that you want to remove from the query.</li>
        <li>Input field for numbers in range.</li>
        <li>Input field for the important words.</li>
        <li>Input field for the important words.</li>
        <li>Input field for the important words.</li>
        <li>Input field for the important words.</li>
      </ul>
3. After that the page has a label displaying if user wants to narrow the results.
4. Then there are the dropLists and one input field which are :
       <ul>
         <li>DropList to find pages in the language that you select</li>
         <li>DropList to find pages published in a particular region.</li>
         <li>DropList to find pages updated within the time that you specify.</li>
         <li>Input Field for searching one site (like wikipedia.org ) or limit your results to a domain like .edu, .org or .gov</li>
         <li>DropList to search for terms in the whole page, page title or web address, or links to the page you're looking for.</li>
         <li>DropList to tell SafeSearch whether to filter sexually explicit content.</li>
         <li>DropList to find pages in the format that you prefer.</li>
         <li>DropList to find pages that you are free to use yourself.</li>
       </ul>

5. Then I have the Advanced Search button at the end.
6. At last there are links just as shown in google advanced search page.

## Workflow

1. User can navigate to google text search page through the google image link.
2. Then there is search field where user can search their queries as explained above and that links to the google search. User can either just press the enter key after completing or filling up the input fields. Alternatively, you can use Advanced Search button to redirect Google search with advanced google searching feature.
